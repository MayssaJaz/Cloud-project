# Cloud Computing Project: Book Boutique
# Made by Mayssa Jaziri & Aycha Abid


This project is a book shop where you can see, add and delete your books.
We deployed the app using Microsoft Azure (the front-end, the back-end as well as the Database which is a MongoDB DB) and we used multiple services.
